                            <p className='text-lg'>“I am grateful to the people who called me fat and patronized me. If it weren't for them, I would still be just as fat!” says Marina Cortés, who has lost 26 kilograms. On the way to a beautiful body, she tried many different diets, but the most effective was a very simple way. Marina told in detail about this method, after which she does not gain extra weight even after weight loss. Here is her fascinating story ... <br /> <br />
                                I've never been a fragile girl, but the extra weight didn't give me any particular reason to have complexes. Having met my future husband Samuel, I completely relaxed and only came to my senses when I got really fat.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div className='font-bold my-5 border-2 border-white border-l-gray-500 px-5 text-3xl !leading-normal'>When I met Samuel, I completely relaxed, only coming to my senses when I got really fat.</div>
                    <p className='text-lg'>Our relationship with Samuel is over 7 years old, and during this time we had two children. But until recently we had, as they say now, "guest marriage." Samuel lived in his apartment, worked a lot and only came to me. And then he was gone again.</p>
                    <p className='text-lg my-2'>From the beginning of our relationship, I constantly waited for him to make the "proposal" to me. That was my dream</p>
                    <div className='font-bold my-5 border-2 border-white border-l-gray-500 px-5 text-3xl !leading-normal'>
                        When will you make the "proposal" to me? That was my dream!
                    </div>
                    <p className='text-lg'>
                        Having become pregnant for the first time, I thought that now we would definitely get married. But it didn't happen. Samuel, it just came and went. And I kept waiting for it... <br /><br />

                        When my eldest son was born, Samuel and I were very happy. He adopted the child, surrounded me with all kinds of care, helped me in everything. I felt that he loved us, but with a special love of his own. <br /> <br />

                        My little son turned 2 years old, we decided to go on vacation together for 2 weeks. Sea, sun and sand. I miss my vacation! <br /> <br />

                        Egypt with a good hotel, a warm beach, food and all inclusive was the perfect option for us. <br /> <br />
                    </p>
                    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/0GvyCHy/woman2.webp" alt="" className='mx-auto w-72' />
                    <p className='my-2 text-lg'>On the beach, I suddenly noticed that Samuel was looking at a girl for a long time. I didn't say anything, but I just decided to watch Samuel. At first I thought he fell in love at first sight. But a little later he changed the object of his attention and he also began to closely observe the other girl, then the third, and so on ad infinitum!</p>
                    <p className=' text-lg'>She was angry! My son and I didn't seem to be close.</p>
                    <div className='font-bold my-5 border-2 border-white border-l-gray-500 px-5 text-3xl !leading-normal'>He likes skinny girls!</div>
                    <p className='text-lg mb-2'>I never wanted to seem like a jealous fool, so having calmed down a bit, I began to analyze. And I quickly realized that all these girls, whom I had been observing for several days, had one thing in common: they are twice as skinny as me! She hit me like lightning, why, she only likes skinny girls! And maybe this is the reason for his behavior in our relationship?</p>
                    <p className='mb-2 text-lg'>
                        I even have a photo where she holds me in her arms, and looks at another "skinny", admires her:</p>
                    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/NrpRJv3/couple.webp" alt="" className='mx-auto w-72' />
                    <p className='my-2 text-lg'>Samuel never told me that he didn't like my figure. He never asked me to lose weight, nothing happened. But there was no "proposal" that he was expecting.</p>
                    <p className='mb-2 text-lg'>
                        These thoughts did not give me rest, and I took advantage of them with a great all-inclusive. I ate there for like three every 2 weeks.
                    </p>
                    <p className='mb-2 text-lg'>
                        Returning from vacation, I weighed myself and was stunned. I brought with me from sunny Egypt, together with a tan, 9.5 kg. I almost had a psychosis.
                    </p>
                    <p className='mb-2 text-lg'>
                        I started studying on the internet about weight loss and a few weeks later I realized I was pregnant for the second time! The holidays were fruitful in the true sense of the word. It is clear that in this state she was not willing to lose weight ... <br /></p>
                    <div className='font-bold my-5 border-2 border-white border-l-gray-500 px-5 text-3xl !leading-normal'>
                        My thoughts were spinning constantly and Samuel didn't like me as a woman
                    </div>
                    <p className='text-lg mb-2'>The idea was spinning in my head that Samuel didn't like me as a woman. I almost had an abortion. I am very glad that Samuel categorically forbade me to even think about it.
                    </p>
                    <p className='text-lg mb-2'>
                        So we had a second child, also a boy. And everything happened again. Samuel adopted the boy and constantly surrounded us with his love, care and attention. But only in those hours when he was with us. In my apartment, there was still not one of his things, except a toothbrush. I wanted to think only about the children, trying not to think about all this.
                    </p>
                    <p className='text-lg mb-2'>
                        After I stopped breastfeeding, I felt the thoughts of losing weight again start to overtake me. I could never forget that vacation, before my eyes was Samuel's look of desire for the skinny girls. In our relationship with him, nothing has changed yet. Right then he weighed a hated 88 kg. <br /></p>
                    <div className='font-bold my-5 border-2 border-white border-l-gray-500 px-5 text-3xl !leading-normal'>So I weighed in the hated 88 kg. And I decided!</div>
                    <p className='text-lg mb-2'>And I decided! What I did not try: diets, probably 10 units, various fitness exercises, wraps, some saunas, special massages, etc. etc All this either did not help, or helped temporarily, I was losing weight and I did not have time to look back when he returned.
                    </p>
                    <p className='text-lg mb-2'>
                        And then I <span className='font-bold'>find myself in the store</span>, in the bakery section with, <span className='font-bold'>Olivia</span> who we were with in the hospital together, when I gave birth to my second. I barely recognized her, she was one and a half times bigger than me, and she became almost 3 times smaller than me, after she was born!
                    </p>
                    <p className='text-lg mb-2'>
                        - Incredible! – I was stunned, instead of greeting enthusiastically. I look at you and I don't believe what my eyes see! Olivia is that really you?
                    </p>
                    <p className='text-lg mb-2'>
                        - What, a little skinny, huh? - Smiling, she asked, buying cakes.
                    </p>
                    <p className='text-lg mb-2'>
                        And you also eat sweets?! How do you do it? As??? I tried and with sports, and diets, and all kinds of saunas, and what kind of crap I have not tried! Well, a maximum of 3 kg less per week and then suddenly I gain 7! I almost screamed then, I really remembered this moment, because people started to turn around.
                    </p>
                    <p className='text-lg mb-2'>
                        Marina, what diets, what saunas? What's wrong with you? In short, everything is clear with you. Let's go with me while my husband is at work, and the boy is in kindergarten, we have tea. I, with pies, and you, with boiling water, at the same time and we will talk, - Olivia exclaimed slyly, narrowing her eyes. <br /></p>
                    <div className='font-bold my-5 border-2 border-white border-l-gray-500 px-5 text-3xl !leading-normal'>Marina, what diets, what saunas? What's wrong with you?</div>
                    <p className='text-lg mb-2'>I was incredibly intrigued and immediately agreed. In addition, the next day, Samuel went on a business trip for 2 weeks, so on the eve I devoted myself entirely to the children. And I could relax a little.
                    </p>
                    <p className='text-lg mb-2'>
                        <span className='font-bold'>Olivia lost 70 pounds</span> in just 3.5 months after she stopped breastfeeding. She didn't diet, she didn't starve, and she didn't go to the gym. She led her normal life, not limiting herself at all.
                    </p>
                    <p className='text-lg mb-2'>
                        Her body became slender, like a girl's. Such a strong weight loss, oddly enough, did not leave a single stretch mark on her skin. Then I still thought that my Samuel would now only eat her with his eyes.
                    </p>
                    <p className='text-lg mb-2'>
                        But I experienced the most powerful emotions after I learned how easily he did it. How easy and safe you can get rid of excess weight. Her recipe of hers to lose weight surprised me!
                    </p>
                    <p className='text-lg mb-2'>
                        I remembered very well that she was trying to lose weight. It was horrible! I remembered my depressions in the context of diets, as we were constantly arguing with Samuel at the time. I remembered the collapse, when later I began to eat without stopping. And he hated me for it.
                        <br />
                        It was even a bit disappointing that I got through all this. It's a pity that all this was in vain, and I need to lose weight in a completely different way. But she wasn't too upset, because now she knew exactly what to do.
                        <br />
                        And now listen carefully to what Olivia to <br /></p>
                    <div className=' rounded-lg border-4 border-gray-400 px-4 py-2'>There are products from which one gets fat. They are known and loved by all. This is sugar, potatoes, cakes, rice, various types of fast food such as: hamburgers, cookies and fries. And there are other products with which you lose weight. Few people know about them. But in their action they are much stronger than those who get fat. If you eat them, then in order to lose weight you do not need to give up the first products.
                        <br /><br />
                        The world's strongest weight loss products. Brown rice is a natural fat burner. Pea protein normalizes fat metabolism, improves the functioning of the whole organism, lowers the level of cholesterol in the blood. Spirulina extract blocks the development of fat cells, a natural source of antioxidants. Natural cocoa accelerates the oxidation of fat, suppresses cravings for sweets, fills with energy, prevents fat deposition in problem areas. Natural bran and cereals suppress appetite, invigorate and fill you with energy.
                        <br /> <br />
                        Based on the composition, it is possible to understand why the effectiveness of the drug is so high. Your body does not need substances, but at the same time the active extracts constantly break down fats. <br /></div>
                    <p className='my-2 text-lg'>Olivia showed me <span className='font-bold underline hover:no-underline'>Green Coffee</span>. It is a complex of natural components for weight loss, which strengthen the action of each other. The main thing is not to forget to take, then the result comes soon.</p>
                    <div className='font-bold my-5 border-2 border-white border-l-gray-500 px-5 text-3xl !leading-normal'>All that is needed is to prepare the coffee and use it according to the recommendations. And that's it!</div>
                    <p>All that is needed is to prepare the coffee and apply it according to the recommendations. And that's it! This is the whole recipe! How about?
                        <br /> <br />
                        The second super news is that this tool can be requested over the Internet. There is the official website of the manufacturer in our country!
                        <br /> <br />
                        After Olivia's story about all of this, she was sitting like "overwhelmed." She would never have believed it, but she had a living example in front of me. I could pinch myself or pinch her to make sure she wasn't sleeping and that Olivia was still standing in front of me.
                        <br /> <br />
                        - But this can not be! So simple? - I murmured then.
                        <br /> <br />
                        - Believe it or not - of course, it is your discretion. If you like difficulties – you will love them more. Do you want to know how I did it? I told you. And now, think for yourself. I am not a salesperson, I have no purpose to "push" you into something. If you want, try it; if you don't want to, drink lots of water, stop eating completely. By the way, do you want cake? Olivia asked, stretching out my favorite tube.
                        <br /> <br />
                        "No thanks, I'll probably go." <br /></p>
                    <div className='font-bold my-5 border-2 border-white border-l-gray-500 px-5 text-3xl !leading-normal'>I did not know then that this hour and a half would change my future life ...</div>
                    <p>We exchanged phone numbers with her, and I left. I spent an hour and a half with Olivia. I didn't know then that in that hour and a half, my future life would change...
                        <br /> <br />
                        I came home like a hash. I instantly fired up the computer and ordered this Green Coffee from the website Olivia gave me. After 3 days, the precious package with Green Coffee was in my hands!
                        <br /> <br />
                        I weighed. The scale read 88.4 kg. From this point on, every day always included the use of 1 cup of Green Coffee after a meal.
                        <br /> <br />
                        The next morning I went back on the scale. 88.5 kg. Plus 100 grams! Yes, I'm upset. There's nothing to say! I almost panic.
                        <br /> <br />
                        I started calling Olivia.
                        <br /> <br />
                        Marina, calm down. The weight begins to rise in 4-5 days. Just keep it up. Forget the scales for 5 days. Then weigh the tea and see what happens,” Olivia replied curiously.
                        <br /> <br />
                        I continued. Especially without changing anything in her diet, she only drank Green Coffee every day after eating. I was really wondering what will happen next. I still did not really believe that I would start losing weight without changing anything in food and lifestyle.
                        <br /> <br />
                        On the sixth day in the morning, I approached the scale and her legs trembled with emotion, I stood on it and closed my eyes. I was very scared to look at the scale, but after a couple of seconds my eyes snapped open. The scale showed 83.3 kilograms. <br /></p>
                    <div className='font-bold my-5 border-2 border-white border-l-gray-500 px-5 text-3xl !leading-normal'>I lost 5 kilograms and 100 grams in the first 5 days, without changing anything in food or doing any exercise!</div>
                    <p>I memorized these first numbers of my success. It was incredible! My heart jumped out of my chest, I could hardly breathe with excitement! Everything went well for me!!!
                        <br /> <br />
                        For the next week, my menu was completely different from how I always ate. Except I had a cup of Green Coffee every day after eating.
                        <br /> <br />
                        I was patient and did not weigh myself. But without weighing myself, I felt like I was removing the weight. Sometimes I felt a pleasant warmth in my hands, belly and hips. I have colossal energy, which I had not felt in a long time. Somewhere the constant fatigue had disappeared.
                        <br /> <br />
                        Picking up on the scale a week later, I almost passed out. They showed 74.7 kilograms. That is to say, during the following week I lost almost 9 kg! <br /></p>
                    <div className='font-bold my-5 border-2 border-white border-l-gray-500 px-5 text-3xl !leading-normal'>In 12 days I became lighter, by 13 kilograms and 700 grams!!!</div>
                    <p>Just imagine that now you have lost weight. Imagine how you feel. Feel how good you are from this, how you like yourself. And then you will understand what I felt.
                        <br /> <br />
                        Of course, I felt my clothes start to hang down a bit. But losing weight in less than 2 weeks is practically 14 kg.  I could not believe what I was watching!
                        <br /> <br />
                        There were 2 days left before Samuel returned from a business trip. I flew as if he had wings, imagining Samuel's reaction to my change. The children also looked forward to Dad very much in anticipation of the gifts he always brought back from his business trips.
                        <br /> <br />
                        On the day of Samuel's arrival, we prepared a gala dinner, prepared a lot of delicious food and even, for the first time in many years, I made his favorite cake.
                        <br /> <br />
                        Samuel arrived just in time for us to finish setting the table. The children, after hearing the sound of the door opening, ran to the hallway to meet their father.
                        <br /> <br />
                        The door opened, on the threshold was Samuel with a large bouquet of flowers. In his hands were boxes of gifts for the children. The boys pounced on his father and he saw me standing over the heads of the children, stupefied. The boxes from his hands fell to the ground. There also fell the bouquet.
                        <br /> <br />
                        The children jumped with happiness, unpacking gifts. Samuel, unable to take his eyes off me, bent down to pick up a bouquet.
                        <br /> <br />
                        After a few seconds, we were alone in the hallway. Samuel stood with the bouquet, as if spellbound. I laughed, taking the flowers from him.
                        <br /> <br />
                        - What are you doing? Let's go soon! <br /></p>
                    <div className='font-bold my-5 border-2 border-white border-l-gray-500 px-5 text-3xl !leading-normal'>- You... This is... But how? -Samuel couldn't control his senses.</div>
                    <p>- Are you going to kiss me or continue standing there?
                        <br /> <br />
                        Samuel suddenly grabbed me, lifted me up and started kissing, and I laughed even more. He shone everywhere, I felt with all my guts how he liked it.
                        <br /> <br />
                        -stop, put me in my place, let's quickly wash our hands and eat
                        <br /> <br />
                        Throughout the night, Samuel walked like "gone". When I put my kids to bed, he pounced on me, like it was the first time. It was a night of insane love, that I couldn't remember everything, I hadn't felt so desirable in many years. Completely exhausted, we just fell asleep until morning.
                        <br /> <br />
                        The next morning, Samuel suddenly out of the blue volunteered to all go to the sea together for 10 days. They closed some kind of successful deal at work, and as a reward they gave them a vacation, handing out some nice bonuses.
                        <br /> <br />
                        I was in seventh heaven - A very good morning like this, it was already a long time ago!
                        <br /> <br />
                        At that time I was an accountant and ran several firms, working mainly from home. No hard work was foreseen in the near future, and I could easily be gone for 1-2 weeks, so I agreed without hesitation. The children were also delighted, because soon we will go to the sea!
                        <br /> <br />
                        This time the choice fell on Tunisia. It was a two-bedroom apartment in a very good 4-star hotel. The trip again included any food in unlimited quantities - an excellent test for my secret recipe! And, of course, he was impatient to see Samuel's behavior on this vacation. <br /></p>
                    <div className='font-bold my-5 border-2 border-white border-l-gray-500 px-5 text-3xl !leading-normal'>All his attention was riveted only on me. Yes, it was my personal victory!</div>
                    <p>A week later, we were already enjoying a warm Tunisian beach, enjoying the incredibly clear sea and the sound of the waves. Samuel didn't take his eyes off me and didn't leave me for a minute. All his attention was riveted only on me. I have never seen him looking at someone else. Yes, it was my personal victory!
                        <br /> <br />
                        We ate well, I did not limit myself to anything. Meat, potatoes, beer, scrambled eggs with bacon, buns, pies - my diet included a complete set of Tunisian all-inclusive. I ate a little, I really didn't like to eat. Of course, every day I made a cup of Green Coffee and drank it after meals.
                        <br /> <br />
                        And at night, after the children, exhausted during the day, fell asleep, Samuel and I drank wine, hugging on the balcony of our room, talking about something and looking at the big moon. Then Samuel took me in his arms and led me to the bedroom, where we made passionate love. We haven't had this much passion since the moment we met. And so it was every day. I felt divine!
                        <br /> <br />
                        The last night before I left, standing on the balcony, Samuel mysteriously asked me to close my eyes. Closing my eyes, I listened as he hurried into the room and back.
                        <br /> <br />
                        - Open the! Samuel said enthusiastically.
                        <br />
                        I opened my eyes. In front of me, on my right knee, was Samuel. In his hands he held a gold ring. <br /></p>
                    <div className='font-bold my-5 border-2 border-white border-l-gray-500 px-5 text-3xl !leading-normal'>- Marina, marry me!
                        My eyes darkened. I've been waiting 7 long years for this!</div>
                    <p>Every day I waited for these words from him. They dreamed of me, many times I imagined how this tells me. I felt tears quickly start to cover my eyes.
                        <br /> <br />
                        - Are you kidding? - Then I couldn't say anything smarter.
                        <br /> <br />
                        - Not a drop! You are the best and the most beautiful in the world, I want you to become my wife. Really! I no longer want to go back and forth. I want us to always be together!
                        <br /> <br />
                        I burst into tears, rushed to Samuel's neck, tearfully whispering: "I agree!"
                        <br /> <br />
                        Immediately upon arrival home, we apply to the registry office. <br /></p>
                    <div className='font-bold my-5 border-2 border-white border-l-gray-500 px-5 text-3xl !leading-normal'>I completely forgot about my weight. For 10 days of rest in the all-inclusive system with Green Coffee, I lost 7.5 kg.</div>
                    <p className='mb-4'>Because of all these events, I completely forgot about my weight. I weighed only after we got back. This time in 10 days of rest in the all-inclusive system with Green Coffee, I lost 7.5 kg. This, of course, is not 1 kg per day, as it was at the beginning, but on vacation I also ate, to put it mildly, not in the same way as always.</p>
                    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/dLf9Jvc/girl-selfie.webp" alt="" className='mx-auto w-72' />
                    <p className='mt-4'>So I didn't even try to lose weight. I started drinking Green Coffee every other day. But despite this, for the wedding I lost another 5 kilograms.
                        <br /> <br />
                        Our wedding with Samuel was a lot of fun. Olivia was my witness: we have become very good friends during all this time. I am immensely grateful to her for an incredibly simple weight loss recipe. <br /></p>
                    <div className='font-bold my-5 border-2 border-white border-l-gray-500 px-5 text-3xl !leading-normal'>Samuel admitted that he secretly always wanted her to be skinny.</div>
                    <p className='mb-4'>Later, Samuel confessed to me that my transformation just drove him crazy. He said that he secretly always wanted me to be skinny, and that he constantly imagined me exactly as I have become now. Of course, he never told me that because he didn't want to offend me. After all, he is very sensitive to me!</p>
                    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/PTnnTPp/girl-laugh.webp" alt="" className='mx-auto w-72' />
                    <p className='my-4'> For the past 3 months, Samuel and I have officially been husband and wife. Now we are engaged in the exchange of our two apartments for a common, large one, which will be spacious and comfortable.
                        <br /> <br />
                        Now I weigh 62 kilograms and 300 grams and my weight does not increase. This is why I have not been drinking Green Coffee for a whole month anymore. In the end, I lost 26 kilograms and 100 grams and, even after more than 7 years of relationship, I continue to bathe in my love, Samuel. This, I tell you, is a fantastic feeling that I deserve! <br /></p>
                    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/DgxZ03N/two-girl.webp" alt="" className='mx-auto w-72' />
                    <div className='font-bold my-5 border-2 border-white border-l-gray-500 px-5 text-3xl !leading-normal'>I lost 26 kilograms and 100 grams. My dream became reality!</div>
                    <p>My dream became reality! And everything turned out even much better than I dreamed! Yes, it helped me when I met Olivia. But it was just an opportunity. I just used it.
                        <br /> <br />
                        These possibilities appear for everyone, although very rarely. But many of the homes, the lack of money and the distrust towards everything, lose it.
                        <br /> <br />
                        Try to see your opportunity always and in everything. In any event around you. In people who for some reason are on the path of your life. In the stories that for some reason caught your attention and that you read - in everything! And when they come - grab them with all your might! This is the biggest secret to achieving true happiness. Taking your chance, you will see that your life will be much better than now, you can't even imagine it.
                        <br /> <br />
                        When I heard Olivia, I also thought at first that this doesn't happen often. I still tried her recipe, this Green Coffee, because we are not told everything beforehand. And he could have simply smiled skeptically and moved on. And then nothing would have changed! Besides, I wouldn't even know that I missed my chance...
                        <br /> <br />
                        For those who are very adamant, really decided to become happy, beautiful, attractive and uncontrollably desired, I will do the same as Olivia did for me. I'll show you where you can find the website of the manufacturer Green Coffee, which she talked about. Just click the button that says, "GO TO MANUFACTURER'S SITE" below and it will open. Everything else is in your own hands. <br /></p>

                                <p className='mt-1'>I lost 12 kilograms in the first month, another 8 kilograms in the second, now I finish my next Green Coffee course. I think that at the end of this course, the total weight reduced will be about 25 kilograms. I think this is a great result in less than three months. Do not believe in the nonsense that it is impossible to lose weight without a diet.</p>
